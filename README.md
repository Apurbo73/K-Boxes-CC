### üîç K Boxes CC:-


This C++ code solves a problem involving **priority-based accumulation** of values while maintaining an efficient record of the **top K largest values** seen so far, according to a specific order defined by the input.

---

### üîç **High-Level Problem Understanding**

For each test case:

* You're given two arrays:

  * `A[i]`: Specifies a *level* or *order* of processing (values from `1` to `N`).
  * `B[i]`: A value (or cost, reward, etc.) associated with position `i`.
* For each index `i`, the goal is to compute `ans[i]` ‚Äî the sum of the **top K largest `B[j]` values** for indices `j` where `A[j] < A[i]`.

---

### üß† **Step-by-Step Code Explanation**

#### 1. **Reading Input**

```cpp
int T; cin >> T;
while (T--) {
    int N, K; cin >> N >> K;
    vector<int> A(N), pos(N+1);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) cin >> A[i];
    vector<long long> B(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) cin >> B[i];
```

* For each test case, input:

  * `N`: number of elements.
  * `K`: how many top values to consider.
  * `A`: array representing level order.
  * `B`: associated values.
* `pos[val]` will store the index of `val` in `A`.

---

#### 2. **Mapping Levels to Indices**

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) pos[A[i]] = i;
```

* For each level `lvl = 1` to `N`, you can now find its index `idx` directly using `pos[lvl]`.

---

#### 3. **Processing Levels in Order**

```cpp
vector<long long> ans(N, 0);
priority_queue<long long, vector<long long>, greater<long long>> minHeap;
long long sumTopK = 0;

for (int lvl = 1; lvl <= N; lvl++) {
    int idx = pos[lvl];
    ans[idx] = sumTopK;
```

* Traverse levels from 1 to `N` in increasing order.
* At each level `lvl`, find its position `idx` in `A`.
* Set `ans[idx]` to the current `sumTopK` ‚Äî sum of top K values seen so far.

---

#### 4. **Maintaining Top-K Heap**

```cpp
    long long val = B[idx];
    if ((int)minHeap.size() < K) {
        minHeap.push(val);
        sumTopK += val;
    } else if (!minHeap.empty() && val > minHeap.top()) {
        sumTopK -= minHeap.top();
        minHeap.pop();
        minHeap.push(val);
        sumTopK += val;
    }
}
```

* Use a **min-heap** to track the K largest values.
* If heap isn't full, just add the new value.
* If heap *is* full and new value is **larger than the smallest in heap**, replace it.
* This maintains the current best K values, with `sumTopK` always holding their sum.

---

#### 5. **Output**

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) cout << ans[i] << " ";
cout << "\n";
```

* After processing all levels, print the result array.

---

### ‚úÖ **Use Case / Conceptual Goal**

This is useful in scenarios like:

* Picking top-K influences before a person joins a network.
* Finding top-K best rewards collected before reaching a level in a game.

This code processes multiple test cases where, for each case, it computes an array `ans` such that `ans[i]` holds the sum of the top `K` largest `B[j]` values corresponding to positions `j` where `A[j]` (a level number) is less than `A[i]`. To do this efficiently, the code maps each level to its index using the `pos` array, then iterates through levels from `1` to `N` in order, updating the result at the corresponding index using the current sum of top `K` values.

To maintain the top `K` values dynamically, a min-heap (priority queue) is used. At each step, the value `B[i]` at the current level is either added to the heap (if there‚Äôs room) or replaces the smallest value in the heap if it‚Äôs larger. This keeps the heap always holding the top `K` largest values seen so far, and `sumTopK` tracks their total. The result array is built in this manner and printed at the end of each test case.
